## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git-ce.rwth-aachen.de/lab-sovereign-data-exchange-2022/team1.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://git-ce.rwth-aachen.de/lab-sovereign-data-exchange-2022/team1/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Automatically merge when pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

## Name
Solid Model Project: Sovereign Data Exchange Lab 2022 (Team 1)

## Description
This repository contains the Solid Model Project in the Sovereign Data Exchange Lab Course of the SS2022 at the RWTH Aachen. 
Solid is a model that enables users to store their data in decentralized Pods, that are like personal web servers that can store data. Here any type of information can be saved within a Solid Pod, access control can be edited and the user has access at all times. 
In this project, a base Solid model including servers and pods will be implemented and tested with a use case.

## Methods
Here are all methods that work within the Solid framework and are the basis of the project: 
- "CreateNotes"
    - Being able to create notes, adding a title and description
- "ReactNote"
    - XXX
- "StoretoPublicPod"
    - Saving a Note to the public pod, which is then accessible to all users that have access to the public pod
- "GiveAccessTo"
    - Give access to friend to private Note. Other users won't be able to access such note.
- "readNote"
    - Read the contents of all accessable nodes.



## Requirements
XXX              

## Installation
XXX

## Running Code
XXX

## Current Use Case Scenario
To be filled.

## Roadmap
Currently working on fixing open issues: 
- Allow user to change access of a public note to private again
- Add friend UI
- Writing/Maintaining README.md
- Frontend, list all notes created by the user
Soon the use case will be implemented and used on the create Solid model



## Authors and acknowledgment
This project is being worked on by Timothy Borrell, Pulkit Arora, Haihua Yang and Omar Mahmoud


## Project status
Ongoing (now in week 5 of the lab)
Currently in Milestone 1 of the lab. (This will be updated)
